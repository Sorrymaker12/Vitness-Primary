        Want to feel better, have more energy and even add years to your life? Just exercise. <br>

        The health benefits of regular exercise and physical activity are hard to ignore. Everyone benefits from exercise, regardless of age, sex or physical ability. <br>
        
        Need more convincing to get moving? Check out these seven ways that exercise can lead to a happier, healthier you. <br>

        <br>1. Exercise controls weight <br>
        Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn. <br>

        Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key. <br>

        <br>2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases <br>
        Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases. <br>

        Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including: <br>

        Stroke <br>
        Metabolic syndrome <br>
        High blood pressure <br>
        Type 2 diabetes <br>
        Depression <br>
        Anxiety <br> 
        Many types of cancer <br>
        Arthritis <br>
        Falls <br> 
        It can also help improve cognitive function and helps lower the risk of death from all causes. <br> 

        <br>3. Exercise improves mood <br>
        Need an emotional lift? Or need to destress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious. <br>

        You may also feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence. <br>
        <br>4. Exercise boosts energy <br>
        Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance. <br>

        Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores. <br>

        <br>5. Exercise promotes better sleep <br>
        Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep. <br>`,

		blogTitle: "How To Build A Healthy Lifestyle",
		datePosted: "2022-01-01",
		category: "Lifestyle",
		desc: `<br>It’s a common myth that getting fit is only about eating healthy and exercising. In reality, creating a healthy lifestyle and maintaining it isn’t about just those two factors—it’s also about being able to keep a positive attitude, strong mental health and a healthy self-image. Although there is a ton of advice out there on how to achieve a healthy lifestyle, here are some key factors to keep in mind: 
        <br>1. Drink more water. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day, but it is essential for our bodies to work properly. Water is absolutely necessary for carrying out our bodily functions, removing waste, and transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout our bodies. Since water is expelled every day through urination, bowel movements, perspiration and breathing, we need to replenish the amount of water in our bodies constantly. The amount of water we need depends on a variety of factors, but generally an average adult needs two to three liters a day. A good way to tell if you are getting enough water is by your urine—which should be either colorless or pale yellow.
        <br>2. Get enough sleep. When you don’t sleep, You tend to eat more. Usually only junk food.
        <br>3. Exercise. Not just a few times a week, but every day. By moving your body in some way for 30 minutes a day, you will lower your risk of disease, create higher bone density and potentially increase your life span.
        <br>4. Eat more fruits and vegetables. All fruits and vegetables carry vitamins and minerals, components essential to your health. It’s suggested that we consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to maintain health.
        <br>5. Eat the rainbow. Pick brightly-colored foods in the produce aisle. These are high in antioxidants (antioxidants remove free radicals in our body that damage our cells) and make a more appealing plate. Here are a few examples to look out for:
        <br>• White (Bananas, Mushrooms)
        <br>• Yellow (Pineapples, Mangoes)
        <br>• Orange (Oranges, Papayas)
        <br>• Red (Apples, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Watermelons)
        <br>• Green (Guavas, Avocados, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Celery)
        <br>• Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Eggplants, Prunes)
        <br>6. Cut down on processed foods. Processed foods are simply not good for you. Most nutritional value is lost in the making of processed foods and the added preservatives are bad for our health. These foods contain a high amount of salt, which leads to high blood pressure and heart disease. In general, the more ingredients on the label, the more processed the item.
        <br>7. Avoid negative people in your life. A positive mentality is key for a healthy life. You don’t need negativity in your life. If you feel that a person or friend is negative, just let him or her go.
        <br>8. Avoid negativity within yourself. You don’t need negativity from yourself, either. Let go of all negative thoughts within yourself. Overeating tends to happen when one feels unhappy, so by staying in a positive state of mind, you cut out an unhealthy dependence on food to be happy.
        <br>9. Avoid trigger foods. These are foods you can’t put down after one bite. Everyone’s trigger foods are different, but typically they consist of candy bars, chocolate, chips, cookies, or anything with high levels of refined sugar, salt, fat or flour.
        <br>10. Take your time eating. Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Don’t rely on a clean plate to tell you when it’s time to stop eating.
        <br>11. Prepare your meals. When you prepare meals yourself, you control exactly what goes in to them. This makes it easier for you to make the right healthy choices for your body.
        <br>12. Move toward low calorie and low fat alternatives. There are many low-fat or non-fat alternatives readily available in all grocery stores. Try switching your full-fat pantry staples for low-fat versions over a period of time.
        <br>13. Stop smoking. Smoking is bad, period. If you’re a smoker, quit for better health—not just for yourself, but for your family and friends. If you don’t smoke, stay that way.
        <br>14. Have healthy snacks on hand. Eating small meals throughout the day is good for your metabolism, but eating the right things is what matters most. When turning to snacks during your day, look for things like fruit, salad, or freshly squeezed juices not from concentrate. These are nutritional and won’t give you a sugar crash.`,

        <h2>------------</h2>
        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        “Ketogenic” is a term for a low-carb diet (like the Atkins diet). The idea is for you to get more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates. You cut back most on the carbs that are easy to digest, like sugar, soda, pastries, and white bread.
        <h2>---------------</h2>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        When you eat less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body eventually runs out of fuel (blood sugar) it can use quickly. This typically takes 3 to 4 days. Then you’ll start to break down protein and fat for energy, which can make you lose weight. <br>This is called ketosis. It's important to note that the ketogenic diet is a short term diet that's focussed on weight loss rather than the pursuit of health benefits.
        <h2>----------------</h2>
        <h2>Who Uses It?</h2>
        People use a ketogenic diet most often to lose weight, but it can help manage certain medical conditions, like epilepsy, too. It also may help people with heart disease, certain brain diseases, and even acne, but there needs to be more research in those areas. Talk with your doctor first to find out if it’s safe for you to try a ketogenic diet, especially if you have type 1 diabetes.
        <h2>--------------</h2>
        <h2>Weight Loss</h2>
        A ketogenic diet may help you lose more weight in the first 3 to 6 months than some other diets. This may be because it takes more calories to change fat into energy than it does to change carbs into energy. It’s also possible that a high-fat, high-protein diet satisfies you more, so you eat less, but that hasn’t been proved yet.        
        <h2>---------</h2>
        <h2>Cancer</h2>
        Insulin is a hormone that lets your body use or store sugar as fuel. Ketogenic diets make you burn through this fuel quickly, so you don’t need to store it. This means your body needs -- and makes -- less insulin. Those lower levels may help protect you against some kinds of cancer or even slow the growth of cancer cells. More research is needed on this, though.
        <h2>-----------------</h2>
        <h2>Heart Disease</h2>
        It seems strange that a diet that calls for more fat can raise “good” cholesterol and lower “bad” cholesterol, but ketogenic diets are linked to just that. It may be because the lower levels of insulin that result from these diets can stop your body from making more cholesterol. That means you’re less likely to have high blood pressure, hardened arteries, heart failure, and other heart conditions. It's unclear, however; how long these effects last.
        <h2>------</h2>
        <h2>Acne</h2>
        Carbohydrates have been linked to this skin condition, so cutting down on them may help. And the drop in insulin that a ketogenic diet can trigger may also help stop acne breakouts. (Insulin can cause your body to make other hormones that bring on outbreaks.) Still, more research is needed to determine exactly how much effect, if any, the diet actually has on acne. 
        <h2>----------</h2>
        <h2>Diabetes</h2>
        Low-carb diets seem to help keep your blood sugar lower and more predictable than other diets. But when your body burns fat for energy, it makes compounds called ketones. If you have diabetes, particularly type 1, too many ketones in your blood can make you sick. So it’s very important to work with your doctor on any changes in your diet.

		blogTitle: "Get Started With Paleo Diet",
		datePosted: "2022-01-01",
		category: "Diet",
		desc: `A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.

        A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds — foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.
        
        Other names for a paleo diet include Paleolithic diet, Stone Age diet, hunter-gatherer diet and caveman diet.
        <h2>----------</h2>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        The aim of a paleo diet is to return to a way of eating that's more like what early humans ate. The diet's reasoning is that the human body is genetically mismatched to the modern diet that emerged with farming practices — an idea known as the discordance hypothesis.

        Farming changed what people ate and established dairy, grains and legumes as additional staples in the human diet. This relatively late and rapid change in diet, according to the hypothesis, outpaced the body's ability to adapt. This mismatch is believed to be a contributing factor to the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and heart disease today.
        <h2>---------------------------------------</h2>
        <h2>Why you might follow a paleo diet</h2>
        You might choose to follow a paleo diet because you:
        <br>Want to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight
        <br>Want help planning meals
        <h2>-------------------------</h2>
        <h2>Details of a paleo diet</h2>
        Recommendations vary among commercial paleo diets, and some diet plans have stricter guidelines than others. In general, paleo diets follow these guidelines.
        <h2>-------------</h2>
        <h2>What to eat</h2>
        Fruits
        <br>Vegetables
        <br>Nuts and seeds
        <br>Lean meats, especially grass-fed animals or wild game
        <br>Fish, especially those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, mackerel and albacore tuna
        <br>Oils from fruits and nuts, such as olive oil or walnut oil
        <h2>----------------</h2>
        <h2>What to avoid</h2>
        Grains, such as wheat, oats and barley
        <br>Legumes, such as beans, lentils, peanuts and peas
        <br>Dairy products
        <br>Refined sugar
        <br>Salt
        <br>Potatoes
        <br>Highly processed foods in general

		desc: `
        A Mediterranean diet incorporates the traditional healthy living habits of people from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, including France, Greece, Italy and Spain.

        The Mediterranean diet varies by country and region, so it has a range of definitions. But in general, it's high in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, beans, cereals, grains, fish, and unsaturated fats such as olive oil. It usually includes a low intake of meat and dairy foods.

        The Mediterranean diet has been linked with good health, including a healthier heart. 
        <h2>---------------------------------------------------</h2>
        <h2>How to make your diet more Mediterranean </h2>
        You can make your diet more Mediterranean-style by:

        <br>eating plenty of starchy foods, such as bread and pasta
        <br>eating plenty of fruit and vegetables
        <br>including fish in your diet
        <br>eating less meat
        <br>choosing products made from vegetable and plant oils, such as olive oil

        <h2>---------------------</h2>
        <h2>The Eatwell Guide</h2>
        The Mediterranean diet is very similar to the government's healthy eating advice, which is set out in the Eatwell Guide. 

        <br>The guide shows what foods are needed for a healthy, balanced diet and how much you should eat of each food group:

        <br>eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day 
        <br>base your meals on starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, rice and pasta (choose wholegrain versions where possible)
        <br>eat some beans or pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, 1 of which should be oily)
        <br>have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks) (choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options)
        <br>choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat them in small amounts
        <br>drink 6 to 8 glasses of fluid a day
        <br>if consuming foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar, have them less often and in small amounts 
        <br>You do not need to achieve this balance with every meal, but try to get it right over the course of a day or even a week.
